When you define a custom user model in Django, you need to update any fields 
in other models that have relations with the user model to use the <span style="color: red;">settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL </span> instead of auth.User. This is required to avoid conflicts and ensure proper integration with your custom user model.

 ```Python
from users import User
from customuser.settings import AUTH_USER_MODEL
use the get_user_model() method from django.contrib.auth
```
